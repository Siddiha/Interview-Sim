# Architecture of InterviewSim

## Overview
InterviewSim is a web application designed to facilitate mock interviews using AI technology. The application consists of a backend built with Flask and a frontend developed using React. 

## Architecture Components

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Structure**:
  - **app**: Contains the core application logic.
    - **api**: Defines the API routes and endpoints.
    - **models**: Contains data models that represent the application's data structure.
    - **services**: Implements business logic and interactions with models.
    - **utils**: Provides utility functions for various tasks.
  - **Configuration**: Managed through environment variables in the `.env` file.
  - **Entry Point**: The application is initiated in `app.py`.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **Structure**:
  - **src**: Contains the source code for the React application.
    - **components**: Houses reusable UI components.
    - **services**: Manages API interactions and application state.
    - **context**: Implements React context for state management.
    - **hooks**: Contains custom hooks for reusable logic.
    - **utils**: Provides utility functions specific to the frontend.
  - **Entry Point**: The application is bootstrapped using `create-react-app`.

## Design Decisions
- **Separation of Concerns**: The application is structured to separate different concerns (API, models, services, etc.) to enhance maintainability and scalability.
- **Use of Environment Variables**: Sensitive information such as API keys and database connection strings are stored in environment variables to enhance security.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across various devices.

## Future Considerations
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of new features and components as needed.
- **Testing**: Implementing unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of both backend and frontend components.
- **Deployment**: Consideration for deployment strategies, including containerization with Docker and cloud hosting solutions.
